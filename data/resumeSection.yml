  ## My Expertises

  I started my career as a software engineer with a strong background in Mathematics.
  
  
  I soon developed a passion for data focused problem solving and went on to pursuse my masters in Machine Learning.


  I am a curious learner and I am always on the lookout for projects that can be uniquely solved using data science and machine learning.

      #### Senior Software Engineer - Data

      ##### rideOS â€“ a Gopuff company

      Worked in the maps team, where I built and deployed several pipelines for accurate data capture of GPS position updates and trip updates.

      
      I further built monitoring dashboards that periodically track the quality of the estimated (ETA) and actual time of arrival (ATA).

      
      I also investigated ML models to improve the performance of ETA predictions and predicting missing speeds on the road network.

      #### Data Scientist

      ##### Daimler Mobility Services

      Worked in the routing team towards improving ETA and route prediction quality.

      
      Built machine learning models to predict real time road statistics such as transition or turn costs and speeds.
    time: 2019-2020 | Berlin, Germany

      #### Machine Learning Intern
      
      ##### Uber Technologies, Inc. 

      Worked in the Fraud detection team where I investigated several machine learning models to identify cases of fraud leading to cancellations.
      
      
      Main focus of my project during this period was the analysis taxi GPS data to identify patterns of fraud due to GPS spoofings.
      I then built a supervised machine learning model to automatically detect cases of repeated fraud due to GPS spoofing in the system.
