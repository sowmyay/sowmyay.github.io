  ## My Expertises

  I started my career as a software engineer with a strong background in Mathematics.
  
  
  I soon developed a passion for data focused problem solving and went on to pursuse my masters in Machine Learning.


  I am a curious learner and I am always on the lookout for projects that can be uniquely solved using data science and machine learning.

      Worked in the Fraud detection team where I investigated several machine learning models to identify cases of fraud leading to cancellations.
      
      
      Main focus of my project during this period was the analysis taxi GPS data to identify patterns of fraud due to GPS spoofings.
      I then built a supervised machine learning model to automatically detect cases of repeated fraud due to GPS spoofing in the system.
