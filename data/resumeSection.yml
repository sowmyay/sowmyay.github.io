  ## My Expertises

  I started my career as a software engineer with a strong background in Mathematics.
  
  
  I soon developed a passion for data focused problem solving and went on to pursuse my masters in Machine Learning.


  I am a curious learner and I am always on the lookout for projects that can be uniquely solved using data science and machine learning.

      MLOps
      - Developed MLOps infrastructure to deploy multiple models via microservices to facilitate real-time serving.
      
      - Spearheaded the efforts to establish MLOps best practices across the organization and automated the training and deployment of ML models.


      ML/Software Engineering
      - Worked on setting up event-based data pipelines in multiple cloud computing environments (GCP, Azure).

      - Built several microservices to host multiple ML models (XGBoost, Pytorch etc).

      - Built data-pipelines and dashboards to track model performances and drift detection, in production.


      Data Science
      - Built multiple models to improve the accuracy of the estimate time of arrival predicted by the routing engine

      #### External ML Contributor

      ##### Ruumi.io

      Ruumi enables farmers to operate productive farms with reduced inputs and lower emissions.
      This is done by monitoring soil health to provide informed solutions to farmers.


      Open source satellite imagery is critical resource for detecting and monitoring soil health.
      However, satellite images are prone to cloud cover which would render them unusable for such applications.


      To solve this challenge, I built a deep learning model to detect and remove clouds in satellite imagery while ensuring image recency and scene accuracy.

      #### Data Scientist

      ##### Daimler Mobility Services

      Worked in the routing team that developed map data and routing algorithms for the autonomous driving technology developed at Daimler.

      
      Developed machine learning models to predict real time road statistics such as transition or turn costs and speeds.
      These in-turn contributed toward improving the predicted route quality.

      #### Machine Learning Intern
      
      ##### Uber Technologies, Inc. 

      Worked in the Fraud detection team where I investigated several machine learning models to identify cases of fraud leading to cancellations.
      
      
      Main focus of my project during this period was the analysis taxi GPS data to identify patterns of fraud due to GPS spoofings.
      I then built a supervised machine learning model to automatically detect cases of repeated fraud due to GPS spoofing in the system.
